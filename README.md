🐍 Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I made this project to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and basic game development concepts.

🎮 About the Game

Control the snake using keyboard arrow keys

Eat the food to grow longer

The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself

Score increases as the snake eats food


This is a classic snake game that we all played on old mobile phones 😄

HTML – Structure of the game

CSS – Styling and layout
